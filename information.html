		     <h3>Evidence of Corruption in Pakistan: </h3>

		      <br>
		     <p>
		     - In 2016, the leak of the Panama Papers brought to light the fact that the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his children owned 4 offshore companies through which they laundered money and facilitated bribes. Sharif received 10 years in jail by Pakistan’s anti-graft court, while his daughter Maryam received 7 years in jail. Sharif also received a lifelong ban from politics, effectively ending his hopes of a political dynasty. <br><br> 
- Pakistan’s Army has had a long history of corruption. According to the borgenproject.org, army officials have engaged in illegal activities such as cross-border smuggling, illegal toll collection at military checkpoints, illegally levying funds from private businesses and extorting landowners in the Okara region. <br><br> 
- Pakistan’s police may be one of the most corrupt ones you could ever possibly meet. They used to take bribes for almost everything, as of now it is decreasing but previously, it was really bad and the police would and probably some still do take bribes from very rich people.  <br><br> 
- Corruption is not only in the Army or Law Enforcement or in Office but it is also in court, getting a job, getting admission in universities. <br><br> 
- In 1947, during the Independence of Pakistan, the leftover assets of the migrating hindus and sikhs in 1947, were supposed to be distributed equally among the people of Pakistan, but they were not.
 <br><br> 
- The Transparency International Corruption Perception Index ranked Pakistan 120 out of 198 countries in 2019. The score of Pakistan was 32/100, the lower the score of the country the more corrupt the country is.
 <br><br> 
- Education seems to have a big impact on corruption, for example, Finland, it is the lowest ranked country in corruption meaning it does not have a lot of corruption and if you look at the education of Finland you can easily see that the people of Finland are more educated. This seems to show that the more the educated people are the less the corruption should be meaning that Pakistan should spend most of its money on improving the country's educational system first rather than focusing on other minor things which could be resolved some time later. <br><br>

		     <h2>Effects & Causes of Corruption: </h2>
                             <p>
			     <br>
			     Soft Forgiving Culture: <br>
			     Pakistan has granted amnesty to many politicians in its history for big crimes. Some of the biggest amnesties involve Asif Ali Zardari, this man caused a lot of corruption as the PM or President of Pakistan, there are rumors about him having killed his wife during the 2007 elections to win and become PM. Another politician who was granted amnesty would be Nawaz Sharif. Nawaz Sharif was going to replace General Pervez Musharraf with General Ziauddin Butt because he wanted to replace the generals who had ruined his credibility. He had ordered the Sindh Police to arrest General Musharraf, but then the General contacted top military generals and soon they took over the country. Nawaz Sharif was arrested for "kidnapping, attempted murder, hijacking and terrorism and corruption" trialed and ended up getting exiled in 2000. He was going to be exiled for 10 years but in 2007 the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that he and his brother could return to Pakistan. <br>
 
<br>


Poor Judicial Infrastructure: <br>
A Woman, Asma Nawab spent 2 decades of her life in jail for a crime she did not commit. The crime was that she murdered her family. She stayed in jail for 20 years, she was arrested in 1998. Then in 2018, the Supreme Court ordered her release since there was not enough evidence of her crimes. According to Dawn News, there is an unequal structure, people who have money and power can bypass the law with ease because of corruption and for the poor this is unequal, people with money can do processes in Pakistan 10 times faster than poor people.   <br>

 <br>

Tax Evasion: <br>
According to tribune.pk, only 1.21 million people in Pakistan pay their taxes. This causes intense amounts of loss to the government. Pakistan is losing tax valued at 6,231,166,000 dollars or 1 trillion pakistani rupees. This does not make sense, 57.5 million people have jobs but only 1.21 million people pay, this is obviously tax evasion. In 2018, there was a tax evasion of 170 billion pakistani rupees. The reason for this is that many business tycoons evade taxes since there is no harsh punishment and most people don’t like to stand in long queues since that is how tax is paid. <br>
 
<br>
Economy: <br>
The economy of Pakistan is in a worse situation than it was 14 years ago. This was the conversion rate of Pakistani Rupees to USD 14 years ago:
This is the conversion rate now:

You can just tell how badly Pakistan’s economy has been affected by corruption in the past 14 years. First, there was Asif Ali Zardari and then there was Nawaz Sharif and now there is COVID since the rate of conversion also decreases when there are so many people converting from a certain currency which is Pakistani Rupees to another which is USD because of COVID. During 2008 - 2017, Pakistan had its most corrupt leaders.  <br>


<br>
Education System: <br>
Yes. There is corruption in the education sector as well in Pakistan. I won’t be going into a lot of detail but some examples of corruption in the education sector include, according to essaywriting.com.pk political appointments is one in which teachers are given higher positions due to their ties with people from the government, ghost schools and teachers is also one, in this the schools don’t exist in real life hence the term. They keep receiving funding while having no teachers, students and plans and basically they scam people into funding them. Sometimes instructors are caught who took bribes from students to give the students cheat sheets. Low salaries of teachers is also a factor in corruption. Finally, when politicians say that they will improve education and all this kind of stuff, 90% of the time, it's a scheme to get more votes when the elections are near so this also allows them to get more votes and they don’t really change anything other than the amount of corruption by increasing it.

                        <h2>Prevention of Corruption:</h2>
			         <p>
The best way to solve these problems would be to first tackle their parent problems for example, the things that cause most of these issues are corruption and injustice and corruption can cause injustice too so corruption we know is the main problem. To solve and get rid of corruption we can’t just hope for it to disappear overnight and that is why I need your help. The laws of Pakistan should become more strict and there should be certain rules or laws that ensure there is no more corruption and even if there is, it is exponentially less and allows the country to progress.
