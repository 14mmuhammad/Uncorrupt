# Uncorrupt
A School Social Studies Project, Tries to Reduce Corruption in Pakistan. The code is not the best and may have some bad names for classes and I apologize for that, I followed this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_Xa7Kn59Es, the images folder is also from the same video. This is the link to the website: https://14mmuhammad.github.io/Uncorrupt/
